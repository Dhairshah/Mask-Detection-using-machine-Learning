* For the calculation and representation it uses OpenCV.
* For the GUI of the program it uses Tkinter.
* To detect face, nose and mouth in a frame it uses Haar Cascade.
* Based on the features identified in a frame it concludes if the person has worn Half Mask, No Mask or Full Mask. The features over here are nose and mouth.
